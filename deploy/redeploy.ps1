.SYNOPSIS
  Redeploy the Magpie server from the canonical deployment clone (Windows / Docker Desktop).

.DESCRIPTION
  Snapshots the database, pulls the requested ref, rebuilds the server image, restarts the
  stack, and waits for the API to report healthy. Idempotent and safe to re-run.

  This is the single source of redeploy logic — both the Deploy GitHub Actions workflow
  (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) and a human at the keyboard call it, so automated and manual
  deploys behave identically.

  The script resolves its own location to find the repo root, so it operates on the real
  deployment clone (which owns server/.env and the pgdata volume), never on a runner's
  ephemeral checkout. .env is gitignored and pgdata is a Docker named volume, so neither is
  touched by `git reset --hard`.

  Database migrations run automatically when the container starts
  (server/docker-entrypoint.sh -> alembic upgrade head) — which is exactly why this script
  takes a pg_dump snapshot FIRST (CLAUDE.md §9 Magpie-specific CD hardening): migrations run
  on boot against financial history, so a bad migration must be a restore, never a loss. The
  last 5 snapshots are kept in a repo-adjacent backups directory (outside the repo, so a
  `git clean` can never touch them).

  No cloudflared/tunnel step — Magpie is tailnet-only by design (CLAUDE.md §0/§8); reachability
  beyond this host is Tailscale Serve fronting the loopback port, set up once per deploy/README.md
  and not something this script needs to touch on every redeploy.

.PARAMETER Ref
  Commit SHA or branch to deploy. Defaults to origin/main. Pass a prior SHA to roll back.

.PARAMETER HealthUrl
  Health endpoint to poll after restart. Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:8005/health (Magpie's
  reserved port — see deploy/README.md's port table).

.PARAMETER TimeoutSeconds
  How long to wait for the health check before failing. Defaults to 120.

.PARAMETER FailureLogLines
  Container log tail dumped on health-gate failure (so an unattended deploy is debuggable
  from the run output). Defaults to 100.

.PARAMETER BackupDir
  Where pg_dump snapshots are kept. Defaults to a sibling of the repo root
  (..\magpie-db-backups relative to this script's parent), never inside the repo itself.

.PARAMETER KeepBackups
  How many recent snapshots to retain. Defaults to 5.

Magpie is household cash-flow tracking with a review-not-enter product law: money events
arrive automatically (alert emails, monthly CSV), deterministic rules file the regular ones,
the local LLM drafts the rest, and the human sees a review queue and deviation alerts.

## System shape

```
Android (Kotlin/Compose) ⇄ Tailscale Serve (HTTPS, MagicDNS) ⇄ FastAPI :8005 ⇄ Postgres :5436
   phone must be on tailnet          │
   (ntfy precedent)                  ├→ IMAP (Gmail label "magpie-ingest") — in-process poller
                                     ├→ LM Studio :1234 (category drafts, insights)
                                     ├→ ntfy :8095 (topic magpie-alerts)
                                     └→ dragonfly-id JWKS (SSO verification, outbound HTTPS)
```

## Deviations from the suite app pattern (all deliberate, all locked)

| Suite norm | Magpie | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Public hostname via Cloudflare tunnel | **Tailnet-only** (Tailscale Serve fronts loopback :8005) | Financial data gets zero internet attack surface; phone is already on the tailnet |
| Password auth + optional SSO | **SSO-only** (no register/login endpoints) | BROKER.md 2e pilot; smallest possible auth surface |
| Synthetic smoke registers a password account | Smoke mints a **suite token** | No password path exists |
| Request-driven server only | **In-process background poller** (FastAPI lifespan task for IMAP) | First app needing scheduled ingestion; one container beats a worker sidecar at this scale |
| — | **Read-only invariant**: nothing on this box can move money | The security identity of the app |

Everything else follows Cookbook: compose layout (minus cloudflared), Alembic
migrate-on-boot, `/health` + `/version`, slowapi, pydantic-settings, NullPool test conftest,
Pulse composite build, suite signing/release/deploy conventions.

## Server design (`server/`)

### The two pure domain packages (the correctness core — no I/O, table-driven tests)

- **`app/ledger/`** — signed-integer-cents arithmetic and classification semantics:
  transfer pairing (card payment ↔ checking outflow nets to zero), refund-as-negative-spend,
  monthly rollups (in/out/by-category/vs-budget). If a number on the phone is wrong, the bug
  is here or in what feeds it — the `nutrition/` / `lists/merge.py` precedent.
- **`app/rules/`** — recurrence matching: cadence windows (biweekly/monthly ± slack),
  amount tolerance bands (rolling median ± pct, for seasonal utilities), merchant
  normalization + matching, transfer-match heuristics, and deviation detection (missing /
  out-of-band / short-paycheck). Deterministic and explainable — every auto-filed
  transaction can cite its rule.

### The ingestion pipeline (`app/ingest/`)

```
Gmail filters → label "magpie-ingest" → IMAP poll (lifespan task, every N min)
  → per-issuer parser template (amex.py / discover.py / usbank.py / …)
  → normalized event: card_swipe | deposit | ach_debit | bill_issued
  → dedupe (message-id + payload hash → ingest_events)
  → rules evaluation (see order below) → transaction row (pending) or bill_statement row
CSV/OFX import (monthly) → institution mapping → match pending→posted / create missed → import_batches
Manual entry (cash only) → same pipeline tail
```

**Testability seams (architectural):** four injected dependencies, each one interface with
a fake — the **clock** (`rules/` and all sweeps take `now`; every recurrence/expiry/
freshness test is a time-travel test), the IMAP fetcher, the LLM client, and the ntfy
publisher (alert tests assert **latching**: one publish per condition episode, not per
sweep). Nothing in the pipeline reads a wall clock or opens a socket directly.

Design rules: parsers are one module per issuer with **committed sanitized `.eml` fixtures**
(public repo — nothing real in git); an email that parses to nothing becomes an `unparsed`
ingest_event surfaced in an operator view + ntfy when the backlog grows, because a silently
broken parser is the pipeline's worst failure mode (the ledger quietly goes stale); the
ingest code never mutates the mailbox (read-only by behavior); every transaction carries
provenance (`source` + event/batch id) so any number is traceable to the email or CSV row
that produced it.

### Rules evaluation order (deterministic first, AI last — always)

1. dedupe → 2. transfer matching → 3. recurring income/bills (in-band ⇒ auto-filed) →
4. merchant→category rules → 5. LLM category suggestion ⇒ `needs_review` draft.
The review queue is the only place AI output meets the ledger, and only via user confirm —
the suite's draft-commit trust model applied to money.

**Cold start:** no rule auto-files until ≥3 observations (seeded by the Phase 3 twelve-month
CSV backfill — bands are rolling medians over matched history). **Scheduled sweeps** (same
lifespan scheduler as the poller): auth-hold expiry (pending, unmatched after ~7 days →
auto-drop with audit note), per-account freshness (no events in N days → staleness alert),
unparsed-backlog check. **Cash rule:** the ATM withdrawal *is* the spend (category `cash`);
manual cash entries are optional detail drawing that bucket down — never parallel spend.

### Domain map (planned)

| Domain | Router | Service | Models |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auth (SSO only) | `suite_auth.py` | `suite_auth` | `User` |
| Accounts/categories | `accounts.py`, `categories.py` | thin CRUD | `Account`, `Category` |
| Transactions + review | `transactions.py` | `transaction_service` (+ `ledger/`) | `Transaction` |
| Rules | `rules.py` | `rule_service` (+ `rules/`) | `Rule` |
| Bills/calendar | `bills.py` | `bill_service` | `BillStatement` |
| Balance anchors | (via `imports.py`) | `import_service` (+ `ledger/`) | `StatementCheckpoint` — stated balance per statement; ledger-vs-statement delta per account is the app's honesty meter and the statement-parity gate's input |
| Budgets | `budgets.py` | `budget_service` (+ `ledger/`) | `Budget` |
| Import | `imports.py` | `import_service` | `ImportBatch`, `IngestEvent` |
| AI | `ai.py` | `services/ai/` (guardrailed) | drafts only, no writes |
| Ops | `export.py`, health/version | `export_service` | generic dump |

## Android design (`android/`, package `com.magpie`)

Suite MVVM (Room + Retrofit + Hilt), Pulse composite build, **teal accent**
(`PulseAccent.Teal` — added to the library in Phase 0). Channel semantics: teal =
money/primary, green = income/under-budget, amber = needs-review, shared red family =
over-budget/deviation.

Screens: Home (month in/out/budget panel + review badge + upcoming-bills strip) · Review
queue (the primary interaction — approve/correct) · Transactions · Bills calendar ("due
before next paycheck") · Budgets · Accounts · Settings (rules + categories editors).

Offline model: read cache in Room; the **only entry surface is cash entry**, which queues
offline (Cookbook check-off precedent). Everything else assumes tailnet reachability —
acceptable because the phone is on Tailscale wherever it has signal. Because Tailscale
Serve provides HTTPS, the manifest needs **no cleartext exception** (unlike Hawksnest's
bare-IP problem).

## Trust boundaries

1. **Internet → Magpie: none.** No public DNS, no tunnel. Reachability = tailnet membership.
2. **Mailbox → Magpie:** a read-scoped-by-behavior IMAP session using a dedicated app
   password/OAuth token in `server/.env`; parser output is untrusted input (validated,
   bounded, deduped) — an attacker who can email you should at worst create a
   `needs_review` draft, never an auto-filed transaction (rules only auto-file against
   *learned history*, not novel senders).
3. **AI:** LM Studio local-only, sees DB-derived context (never raw emails), output
   Pydantic-validated, persists only through user confirmation.
4. **Money movement: impossible by construction** — no credentials with write power exist
   in this system, and no feature may introduce them (see ROADMAP.md non-goals: no bill pay).
5. **Backups:** Magpie's dumps ride the nightly NAS pipeline, which must be encrypted at
   rest first (host ROADMAP2 Tier 1 #10 — blocking precondition).

## Failure modes to design for (ranked)

1. **Silent parser rot** (issuer redesigns its email) → unparsed-event counter + ntfy on
   backlog growth + fixtures pinning every template (sourced from the Phase −1 real-email
   corpus) + raw payloads kept in `ingest_events` with `parse_version` so a fixed parser
   **replays history** — a bad parse is recoverable, never permanent.
2. **Double-count via transfers or cash** → `ledger/` transfer semantics + pairing tests
   (every `transfer_group` sums to zero) + the ATM-is-the-spend cash rule; these are the
   classic self-built-tracker bugs and they're designed out at the model layer.
3. **Balance drift from reality** (unknown opening balance, missed events, interest) →
   `statement_checkpoints` anchor the ledger to each statement's stated balance; the
   per-account delta is surfaced, and the **statement-parity gate** (two consecutive months
   to the penny post-reconciliation) is v1's acceptance criterion.
4. **Pending/posted drift** (tip adjustments) and **auth holds that never post** → CSV
   reconciliation updates matched rows in place; the expiry sweep drops unmatched pendings
   after ~7 days with an audit note.
5. **Alert-coverage illusion** (an account quietly stops alerting) → per-account
   "last event seen" freshness on the Accounts screen + a staleness alert via ntfy.
6. **Tailscale outage** → app degrades to cached reads; ingestion pauses and catches up
   (IMAP is pull — nothing is lost, the label retains the mail).

## Operational fit (host-side, lands in Phase 8)

Monitoring a tunnel-less app needs its own answer: **uptime-kuma** watches
`http://host.docker.internal:8005/health` (server liveness — kuma is a container and can't
reach the tailnet mapping), while **`Test-SuiteInvariants.ps1`** watches what kuma can't:
`tailscale serve status` still carries the Magpie mapping. The invariant checker also needs
a **per-app exception list** — Magpie legitimately fails the suite-wide
`COMPOSE_PROFILES=tunnel` assertion, and must be exempted *before* first deploy or it pages
a false alarm. Config distribution: the hub's broker serves `config/magpie` (the ts.net
base URL) to the app's `SuiteConfigReader`, same as siblings. Backups: magpie-db rides the
nightly `*-db-1` dump pipeline (verify the glob picks it up) — which is itself gated on the
encrypted-dumps precondition.
